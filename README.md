# JSON Feint Protocol
The JSON Feint Protocol (JFP) is a TCP application-layer protocol designed in-house by Ultz, which aims to act as a simple, extensible solution for just about anything you need. JFP includes a system for sorting payloads by payload type and ID, making it easy to implement command systems (as seen in the Ultz Online GCM) or multiplexing systems. Version 2 of this package supports JFP/1.0, JFP/1.1, and JFP/N.
